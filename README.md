Interlutions Static Code Analysis Tools
========================================

We at Interlutions love clean code. So we use several static code analysis tools across frameworks, e-commerce 
and content management systems. This package contains the following tools:
- [PHPLint][1]
- [PHPMD][2]
- [PHPStan][3]
- [PHPCPD][4]

## Installation

If you use [Composer][5], you can just include the Interlutions Static Code Analysis Tools in your project with 
the following command:

    composer req interlutions/static-code-analysis-tools

## Usage
There is not global usage of all this tools. This repository is just merging the dependencies.
